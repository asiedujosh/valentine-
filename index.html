<h2>Hi Beautiful,</h2>

<h4>
I might not be the kind of guy you would call a perfect guy. I might not have everything and
might not be able to make you smile every time but from the day I met you, I could never stop 
thinking about you. The moment I spend with you becomes a memory that keeps repeating in my head.
Whenever I see you smile, there is always a happiness in me. I might not have been much of anything, but believe me,
I love you more than i do for myself. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I LOVE YOU
